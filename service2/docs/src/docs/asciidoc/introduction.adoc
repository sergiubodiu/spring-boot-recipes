== Introduction
The {osbapi-href} defines an HTTP interface between the services marketplace of a platform and a service broker.

Service brokers are responsible for:

* Advertising a catalog of their service offerings and plans
* Provisioning (creating or updating) service instances
* Creating bindings between a service instance and a client application
* Deleting bindings between a service instance and a client application
* Deprovisioning (deleting) service instances

The {scosb-href} project provides the scaffolding for an {osbapi-href}-compliant service broker by implementing the required Spring web controllers, domain objects, and configuration. 
Service broker authors can provide Spring beans that implement the {scosb-api-services}package-summary.html[appropriate interfaces].
